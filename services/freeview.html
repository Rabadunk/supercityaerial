				<h2> What Is Freeview? </h2>

				<h3> New Zealands free HD TV broadcaster </h3>

				<p> Freeview services consists of high definition capable digital terrestrial television, Freeview|HD, and standard definition, digital satellite television. This means you can get TV signals from both UHF aerials or satellite dishes. However, from a satellite dish, you get 16 channels only and they are not HD. From UHF aerials, not only do you get 25 channels but they are also HD (Broadcast Dependent).</p>

				<h2> How To Get Freeview </h2>

				</ul>

				<p>1. Right Antenna: Check on your roof if you have an aerial similar to the aerials in the pictures above. These are the types of UHF aerials that are commonly used and this is the aerial type that picks up Freeview signal.</p>

				<p>2. Digital ready TV: If the tuning menu of your TV has a digital option available, your TV is good to go. Just connect the aerial cable to the antenna port on the back of your TV and continue to tune your menu.</p>

				<p>3. If your TV is not Freeview ready (digital ready): You need one of the Freeview set-top boxes (eg. igloo tv box). Connect the aerial cable to the set-top box and use an AV or HDMI lead to connect the set-top box to the TV for display. We recommend an HDMI cable for best picture quality.</p>

				<h3>New UHF Aerial installation </h3>

				<img src="../images/installation.jpg">

				<p>There are three facts in mind when we do a new TV aerial installation - Signal reception, your property and the weather. It is important to scan for the best signal reception point to decide where to install the TV aerial first because signal reception is not the same everywhere on your roof.

				<p>We recommend an attic installation as this is the best place to install aerials, it avoids drilling into your roof and protects the aerial against weather. This is suitable for tile roof houses. It works inside iron roofs as well depending on roof shape. We can check this for you.</p>

				<p>We have brackets that allow aerials to be attached to the back of the sky dish and dish signal or terrestrial signal can be easily combined and transmitted via the same cable. We also have under eave brackets which enables us to install aerials under the eave, either bracket avoids drilling onto the roof.</p>

				<p>We consider roof installation as the last option. If you do choose to have it on the roof or if there isn't any other option you'll be glad to hear every screw will be water tight with silicon.</p>

				<h3>VHF To UHF Aerial Upgrade</h3>

				<p>Check the aerial on your roof if you have UHF or if it is VHF. A UHF aerial is the one that picks up digital TV signals. When we do Aerial upgrades, we first remove the VHF aerial if possible before putting on the new UHF aerial. This is to reduce the chance of the aerial being blown down by wind. The only reason  we would not remove the VHF aerial is if it's out of reach and not safe to remove. If this is the case, the new UHF aerial will be attached below the VHF aerial. Also take note, in replacement installation, the existing pole and cabling is reused and only the aerial is replaced.</p>

				<h3>Signal Repair</h3>

				<p>There are many reasons why your TV may not be working or your TV's picture is breaking. If you already have a UHF aerial but your TV is still not working or not working properly it could be one of the following:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>- The cabling, because Freeview is broadcast in digital and in High definition, RG6 cable is required for faster transfer of TV signal from the antenna to TV without major loss of signal.</li>

					<li>- F-type connector is required to make sure every connection has good contact.</li>

					<li>- Old type splitter and joiner also causes TV signal problems.</li>

					<li>- In some cases, TV aerials need to move.</li>

					<li>- Faulty masthead amplifier.</li>


					<li>- Wall socket.</li>

				</ol>
