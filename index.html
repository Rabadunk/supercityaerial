				<h2> What we do.  </h2>

				<h3> Our skill is the unified force of experience, intellect and passion in our operation.</h3>

				<p> We service houses Auckland wide including the Rodney district. Our expertise includes experience in UHF Antenna Installation, VHF To UHF Upgrade, TV Signal Repair, Satellite Dish Installation, SKY TV Services, Cabling, TV Wall-Mounting and Home Theatre Setup. What sets us apart however is that we also provide commercial building TV networking. Though the aerial and dish used are the same for both commercial and residential, the infrustructure is different. For new installation, prices are made with an onsite quotation. If you contact us for repair, please note that we need to know the distribution hub as this is where the aerial cables and amplifiers are and in most cases is where the problem is.</p>
